# Overland Military Vehicles
A multiplayer battle arena with Asteroids-style controls, designed to be playable with just one keyboard (if you have the right hardware). Made with the Duality game engine.

To play: Clone the repo or download as a .zip file, and open the DualityEditor.exe file. The game editor will open up and the necessary dependencies will be downloaded and installed. To launch the game, hit the "start sandbox" button to run it in the editor, or the "run game" button to launch it as it would be done in production, both located in the toolbar on the top. (The latter can also be done by running the DualityLauncher.exe file in the root folder). All game objects can be viewed in the editor, and the source code can be inspected with the respective button in the top toolbar, if you have Visual Studio installed.
