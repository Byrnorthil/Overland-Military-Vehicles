# Overland Military Vehicles
A multiplayer battle arena with Asteroids-style controls, designed to be playable with just one keyboard (if you have the right hardware). Made with the Duality game engine.

To set up: Clone the repo or download as a .zip file, and open the DualityEditor.exe file. The game editor will open up and the necessary dependencies will be downloaded and installed. To launch the game, hit the "run game" button in the toolbar at the top, or run the DualityLauncher.exe file in the root folder. For information on how to use the editor and inspect the code, visit https://docs.duality2d.net/

To play: Use the directional keys to thrust and turn, and the fire key to use weapons and powerups. Land hits on the other players' vehicles to deplete their health until they are destroyed. Item boxes can be run into to collect new weapons to use, until they run out of ammo.
