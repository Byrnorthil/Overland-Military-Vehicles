# Overland Military Vehicles
A multiplayer battle arena with Asteroids-style controls, designed to be playable with just one keyboard (if you have the right hardware). Made with the Duality game engine.

To play: Clone the repo or download as a .zip file, and open the DualityEditor.exe file. The game editor will open up and the necessary dependencies will be downloaded and installed. To launch the game, hit the "run game" button in the toolbar at the top, or run the DualityLauncher.exe file in the root folder.
